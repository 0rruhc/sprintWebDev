                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering an area of approximately 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles) across nine countries in South America: Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas region of France). It is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" because it produces around 20% of the world's oxygen.</p>

                <h2>Importance</h2>
                <p>The Amazon Rainforest is essential for maintaining the planet's ecological balance. It is home to about 10% of the world's species and plays a critical role in regulating the global climate by producing around 20% of the Earth's oxygen and absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide, helping mitigate climate change. The forest also influences rainfall patterns through its water cycle, which affects agriculture and water supply across regions. Furthermore, it provides vital resources for millions of indigenous people and has medicinal and agricultural value. Its destruction could disrupt global weather systems and biodiversity, underscoring its importance in sustaining life on Earth.</p>
